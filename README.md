# **Applications of Predictive Modelling on Bank Customer Transaction Data**

This project leverages customer transaction data to uncover actionable insights for Lloyds Bank, focusing on customer segmentation, clustering analysis, time series forecasting, and churn prediction. Conducted as part of the Data Science program at the University of Bristol, the study utilizes advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to optimize customer relationship management and enhance banking operations.

## **Project Overview**
- **Objective**: Analyze customer transaction data to predict behaviors, improve customer retention, and inform strategic banking decisions.
- **Data Sources**: Artificially generated transactional datasets provided by Lloyds Bank.
- **Key Areas of Analysis**:
  - **RFM Analysis**: Segmentation of customers based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value.
  - **Clustering**: Identification of spending patterns using K-Means and DBSCAN clustering.
  - **Time Series Forecasting**: ARIMA model to forecast future transaction volumes.
  - **Churn Prediction**: Predicting customer churn using CatBoost to enhance retention strategies.

## **Features**
- **RFM Analysis**:
  - Categorized customers into segments like High-Value, Loyal, Emerging, Lost, and Need Attention based on their transactional behavior.
  - Generated actionable insights to optimize services for different customer profiles.
- **Clustering**:
  - Applied K-Means and DBSCAN for customer grouping based on spending patterns.
  - Visualized clusters using PCA for dimensionality reduction.
- **ARIMA Forecasting**:
  - Predicted 30 days of future balances for customer accounts, aiding strategic planning.
